# project summary 

## In our project we  developed a web application in CROSS PLATFORM that will be suitable for IOS and ANDROID users,

### 1-  Conditions (area, type of attraction, which group is appropriate, duration of attraction) .
### 2- Selecting a route  and displaying it on a map or list (sorted by the order of route) . 
### 3- Shows the first N quality attractions according to ratings.

## We  recommend  an application according to the weather and the area it located in .
##  At the same time, we developed a  well-designed website that explains the application and supports the registration of the business      owners, so that they can add their attractions, we could use the API of attractions in Israel, but we give a chance to  the business owners who do not exist in the API have the opportunity to present their business in the application.
